Module : SINSTANCE.CPP
Purpose: Defines the implementation for an MFC wrapper classe
         to do instance checking
Created: PJN / 29-07-1998
History: PJN / 25-03-2000 Neville Franks made the following changes. Contact nevf@getsoft.com, www.getsoft.com
                          1. Changed #pragma error to #pragma message. Former wouldn't compile under VC6
                          2. Replaced above #pragma with #include
                          3. Added TrackFirstInstanceRunning(), MakeMMFFilename()
         PJN / 27-03-2000 1. Fixed a potential handle leak where the file handle m_hPrevInstance was not being
                          closed under certain circumstances.
                          Neville Franks made the following changes. Contact nevf@getsoft.com, www.getsoft.com
                          2. Split PreviousInstanceRunning() up into separate functions so we
                          can call it without needing the MainFrame window.
                          3. Changed ActivatePreviousInstance() to return hWnd.
         PJN / 15-05-2000 1. Serialized access to all of the CSingleInstance class to prevent race conditions
                          which can occur when you app is programatically spawned.
         PJN / 17-05-2000 1. Updated sample to show how the code can be used for dialog based apps.
         PJN / 01-01-2001 1. Added a number of asserts to CInstanceChecker::ActivatePreviousInstance
                          2. Now includes copyright message in the source code and documentation.
         PJN / 15-01-2001 1. Now allows multiple calls to PreviousInstanceRunning without ASSERTing
                          2. Removed some unnecessary VERIFY's from ActivatePreviousInstance
                          3. Made the MMF filename used modifiable via a virtual function GetMMFFilename 
                          4. Made the window to track modifiable via a virtual function GetWindowToTrack
                          5. Made destructor virtual since the introduction of other virtual functions in the class
                          6. Removed a number of unnecessary verifies
                          7. Changed the meaning of the return value from TrackFirstInstanceRunning
         PJN / 17-06-2001 1. Moved most of the code from CInstanceChecker::CInstanceChecker to 
                          CInstanceChecker::ActivateChecker. This allows client code to turn on or off the instance
                          checking code easily. Thanks to Anders Rundegren for this addition.
         PJN / 31-08-2001 1. made the name of the mutex which the class uses to serialize access to itself a paramter
                          to the constructor. That way multiple independent apps do not block each other while
                          they are calling into the CSingleInstance class. Thanks to Eugene Shmelyov for spotting
                          this problem.
         PJN / 23-03-2002 1. Provided a QuitPreviousInstance method. Thanks to Jon Bennett for providing this.
         PJN / 30-10-2002 1. The name of the internal memory mapped file is now based on the Mutex name rather than
                          the application name. An example: a client was writing a webcam application and wanted it to 
                          run with multiple configuration for multiple camera support. So the app can run multiple times 
                          as long as a special configuration is given on the command line. But for that configuration 
                          only one instance is allowed. Using the application name for the memory mapped file was tying 
                          the single instance to the app rather than the unique mutex name. Thanks to Frank Fesevur for 
                          this nice update.
         PJN / 06-02-2003 1. Was missing a call to ReleaseLock in CInstanceChecker::ActivatePreviousInstance. Thanks to 
                          Pierrick Ingels for reporting this problem.
         PJN / 09-05-2004 1. Updated the copyright details.
                          2. Extended CInstanceChecker::ActivatePreviousInstance to now allow the command line of the
                          second app to be passed to the original app. By default the parameter is NULL, meaning that 
                          you get the original behaviour which just activates the previous instance. To respond to this
                          information you should add the following to your mainfrm module:

                          mainfrm.h

                          afx_msg LRESULT OnCopyData(WPARAM, LPARAM);


                          mainfrm.cpp

                          LRESULT CMyFrameWnd::OnCopyData(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
                          {
                            COPYDATASTRUCT* pCDS = reinterpret_cast<COPYDATASTRUCT*>(lParam);
                            TCHAR* pszCmdLine = static_cast<TCHAR*>(pCDS->lpData);
                            if (pszCmdLine)
                            {
                              //DO SOMETHING with pszCmdLine here such as call AfxGetApp()->OpenDocumentFile(pszCmdLine);
                            }
                            return TRUE;
                          }

                          Also hook up your onCopyData to the windows message map using

                          ON_MESSAGE(WM_COPYDATA, OnCopyData)


                          Thanks to Ingo H. de Boer for providing this nice update.

                          3. Following a discussion on the Codeproject.com discussion forum for CSingleInstance on what
                          exactly a single instance app means (See http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/csingleinst.asp?msg=766108#xx1103xx),
                          Daniel Lohmann has produced a simple function called CreateUniqueName which given a number of 
                          settings as flags, will produce a name which is unique. This code can be downloaded at 
                          http://www.losoft.de/code/SingleInstance.zip. You can then use this name in the constructor for
                          CInstanceChecker. The concept of a single instance app is complicated by the concept of Window stations
                          and desktops as used by NT Services and Windows Terminal Services. In addition you might want to allow your
                          program to be run once per user. 
         PJN / 30-05-2005 1. Fix for a crash where CWnd::GetLastActivePopup can sometimes return a NULL pointer. Thanks to 
                          Dominik Reichl for reporting this bug.
         PJN / 07-07-2006 1. Updated copyright details.
                          2. Addition of CSINGLEINSTANCE_EXT_CLASS and CSINGLEINSTANCE_EXT_API which allows the class to be easily used
                          in an extension DLL.
                          3. Removed derivation from CObject as it was not really needed.
                          4. Updated the documentation to use the same style as the web site.
                          5. Code now uses newer C++ style casts instead of C style casts.
                          6. Fixed a number of level 4 warnings in the sample app.
                          7. Updated code to compile cleanly using VC 2005.
         PJN / 17-03-2007 1. Updated copyright details.
                          2. Optimized _INSTANCE_DATA constructor code
                          3. Reworked how the method CInstanceChecker::GetMMFFilename creates the name of the memory mapped filename
                          the code requires for sharing. Now the main instance name appears before the hard coded string. This
                          ensures that the CInstanceChecker class works correctly for terminal sessions i.e. kernel objects prefixed
                          with the value "Local\". Thanks to Mathias Berchtold for reporting this issue.
                          4. Updated the sample app code to clean compile on VC 2005
                          5. QuitPreviousInstance now uses GetLastActivePopup API to ensure it posts the WM_QUIT message to the 
                          correct window of the previous instance.
         PJN / 02-02-2008 1. Updated copyright details
                          2. Removed VC 6 style classwizard comments from the sample apps code
                          3. Updated ActivatePreviousInstance method to support Win64 compliant data
                          4. ActivatePreviousInstance now takes a "dwTimeout" parameter which it now uses internally as the timeout when
                          calling SendMessageTimeout instead of SendMessage. The code now uses SendMessageTimeout instead of SendMessage 
                          to ensure we do not hang if the previous instance itself is hung. Thanks to Paul Shore for suggesting this 
                          update.
                          5. Updated the sample apps to clean compile on VC 2008
