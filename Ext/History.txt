  commercial "Password Keeper" software
- CSV files can now be imported (Password Keeper compatible)

  opening the search dialog and clicking OK (so without
  entering a search string)

  lead to problems on some computers when compiling with VC.NET

  executable file name)

  in the command line on startup
- KeePass can optionally open the last used database (see
  settings dialog)
- Usability option: the small icons on the buttons can
  optionally be disabled
- Fixed a string visibility bug when using German translation
  in the 'open database' dialog
- Workspace can be locked (so you don't have to close and open
  your database when you quickly want to go away from the
  computer)

03/11/21 - 0.81
- Minor changes in the password manager class (added additional
  checks for function parameters)

  string was invisible because it exceeded the window rectangle
  in the dialog)

  drag-n-drop.
