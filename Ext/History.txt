- Usability fix: OK and Cancel buttons have been swapped
- KeePass remembers the directory of the last saved or loaded
  database
- A database is loaded automatically if its path is supplied
  in the command line on startup
- KeePass can optionally open the last used database (see
  settings dialog)
- Usability option: the small icons on the buttons can
  optionally be disabled
- Fixed a string visibility bug when using German translation
  in the 'open database' dialog
- Workspace can be locked (so you don't have to close and open
  your database when you quickly want to go away from the
  computer)

- Minor changes in the password manager class (added additional
  checks for function parameters)
- String visibility bug in the option dialog fixed (the German
  string was invisible because it exceeded the window rectangle
  in the dialog)
- Now not only passwords can be drag-n-dropped to other windows
  but all fields (thanks to M. Widmann for this
  suggestion). Just point on the field you want to drag-n-drop.
