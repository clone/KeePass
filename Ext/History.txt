- Groups are movable now (like the entries, see context menu)
- GUI: Removed moving options from main menu (of course not
  from the context menus) because of space issues
- Removed the manifest file from the project because it somehow
  lead to problems on some computers when compiling with VC.NET
- Added check for open file before opening another one
- Improved command-line parsing routine (independent from
  executable file name)
- Command-line file now overrides the auto-open feature
- Fixed a small bug in the lock-workspace routine
- Improved the internal memory encryption function (not the
  database encryption algorithm) a bit (uses length as key now)

- Usability fix: OK and Cancel buttons have been swapped
- KeePass remembers the directory of the last saved or loaded
  database
- A database is loaded automatically if its path is supplied
  in the command line on startup
- KeePass can optionally open the last used database (see
  settings dialog)
- Usability option: the small icons on the buttons can
  optionally be disabled
- Fixed a string visibility bug when using German translation
  in the 'open database' dialog
- Workspace can be locked (so you don't have to close and open
  your database when you quickly want to go away from the
  computer)

03/11/21 - 0.81
- Minor changes in the password manager class (added additional
  checks for function parameters)
- String visibility bug in the option dialog fixed (the German
  string was invisible because it exceeded the window rectangle
  in the dialog)
- Now not only passwords can be drag-n-dropped to other windows
  but all fields. Just point on the field you want to
  drag-n-drop.
