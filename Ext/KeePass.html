The application doesn't need to be installed. The KeePass development team provides you
an installer which automates creating links in the startmenu etc., but you also can download
the binary zip package which contains only the main executable, which runs fine without installing
anything.<br />
<br />
KeePass doesn't, in contrast to many other applications, use any functions that require
the latest Windows operating system, such like theming on XP or like a .NET application requiring a .NET
framework.<br />
<br />
KeePass doesn't store anything on your system. The program doesn't create any new
registry keys and it doesn't create any initialization files (ini) in your Windows directory.
Deleting the KeePass directory (in case you downloaded the binary zip package) or using the
uninstaller (in case you downloaded the installer package) leaves no trace of KeePass on your
system.<br />

Today you need to remember many passwords. You need a password for the Windows
network logon, your e-mail account, your homepage's ftp password, online
passwords (like CodeProject member account), etc. etc. etc. The list is
endless. Also, you should use different passwords for each
account. Because if you use only one password everywhere and someone gets this
password you have a problem... A serious problem. He would have access to your
e-mail account, homepage, etc. Unimaginable.<br><br>
But who can remember all those passwords? Nobody, but KeePass can.
KeePass is a free, open-source, light-weight and easy-to-use password safe for Windows.<br>
<br>
The program stores your passwords in a highly encrypted database.
This database consists of only one file so it can be transferred from one computer
to another easily.<br><br>
KeePass supports password groups, so you can sort your passwords (for example into
Windows, Internet, My Homepage, etc.).
You can drag-n-drop passwords into other windows.
The program can export the database to TXT, HTML, XML or CSV files.<br><br>
For sure, you can also print the password list or current list view (see groups).
Using the context menu of the password list you can quickly copy password or user name
to the Windows clipboard.
Searching in password database is possible.<br><br>
KeePass can be translated into other languages very easily (currently English
and German are available).
The program has a strong random password generator (you can define the possible
output characters).<br>
<br>
And the best: it's free and you have full access to its source code!<br>
<br>
KeePass is a Windows application. It has been developed using Microsoft Visual C++
with MFC classes. No .NET framework is required, nor any other special DLLs. So
it should run on all Windows operating systems.<br>
<br>
KeePass is distributed under a BSD-style license. To sum it up a bit:
you can use it freely, modify the source code yourself if you log your changes
and don't remove my original header. Because it's free, there is no warranty
of any kind. See the file "License.html" in the downloadable KeePass zip package
for details.
<br><br>

<table class="tablebox"><tr><td class="boxtitle">
&nbsp;<a name="keyinfo" id="keyinfo"></a>Master passwords and key-disks</td></tr></table>
<br>
KeePass stores your passwords securely in an encrypted database. This database
is locked with a master password or key-disk.<br>
<br>
If you use a master password you only have to remember one password or passphrase
(which should be good then!).<br>
<br>
If you lose this master password, all your other passwords in the database are lost too.
The database is encrypted based on mathematics and there isn't any
backdoor or a key which can open all databases. There is no way of recovering your
passwords.<br>
<br>
But you don't even have to remember a long, complicated master passphrase.
The database can alternatively be locked with a key-disk. A "key-disk" is just
a normal disk which holds a file with the password bytes (KeePass can generate
such disks for you).<br>
<br>
If you lose the key-disk and have no backup copy of the key-file your
passwords in the database are lost too, just as when you lose the master passphrase.<br>
<br>
If you want to burn a master key CD-ROM select a writable drive (C: D: ?) and
generate the master key-file. Burn the file "pwsafe.key" (i.e. C:\pwsafe.key or D:\pwsafe.key)
into the root directory of your CD-ROM (i.e. E:\pwsafe.key).
You can then insert the key CD-ROM and select the CD-ROM drive in KeePass to
load the key from CD-ROM. For sure, you can do the steps above for any writable
and readable media, not just CD-ROMs.<br>
<br>
So you must decide: either use a really good master password or a key-disk.

<br>
In this section I will tell you how the databases are encrypted. If you
aren't a cryptographer and don't know anything in the security field you won't
understand that much. In this case just believe me it's secure ;-)<br>
<br>
All databases are encrypted. Currently they are encrypted using the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES/Rijndael), a 128-bit block cipher, using a 256-bit key.
I've chosen the CBC block cipher mode. A 128-bit initialization vector (IV) is
generated randomly each time you save the database.<br>
<br>
In order to generate the 256-bit key for AES the secure hash algorithm SHA-256
(which belongs to the SHA-2 family) is used. The user key (the passphrase
the user enters or the binary string in the key-file) plus a random salt
is hashed using SHA-256. The random salt is generated randomly each time you
save the database and saved in it.<br>
<br>
Each time you start KeePass, the program will perform a quick self-test where
the AES/Rijndael cipher and the SHA-256 are tested against their correct test vectors.<br>
<br><br>

<table class="tablebox"><tr><td class="boxtitle">
&nbsp;<a name="keeint" id="keeint"></a>Internals</td></tr></table>
<br>
There is a password manager class (<code>CPwManager</code>) which handles all the operations
concerning the database. It exports functions for editing groups, edit password
entries, move them, etc.<br>
<br>
The passwords are encrypted while running. So if Windows decides to cache
the KeePass process to disk the passwords will be encrypted and a possible
attacker couldn't read the passwords anyway.<br>
<br>
The class <code>CPwExport</code> handles all the export functions. It can export the complete
database or just one group. I decided not to include an XML library which would
blow up the KeePass application horribly.<br>
<br>
The file <code>"memutils.h"</code> contains some memory and buffer functions like securely
erasing a buffer by overwriting it several times before setting it to zero,
the same for CStrings, a routine for copying strings to the Windows clipboard
and a routine for securely deleting files.<br>
<br>
The <code>CNewRandom</code> class is a new pseudo-random number generator. It's based on the
SHA-256 hash which hashes random sources with a counter to generate secure
random bytes. By standard the random sources are various pseudo-random sources
like current mouse position, tick counter, time and date, etc. When more
security is needed (for example when generating the key-disk file),
the class accepts other random sources (see the dialog for getting random data
using mouse movement and typing random characters).<br>
