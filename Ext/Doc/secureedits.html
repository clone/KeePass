KeePass was the first password manager featuring more secure edit controls. The
edit controls used in KeePass are resistant to password revealers and password
control spies. Additionally, the entered passwords are protected against
memory dumping attacks: the passwords aren't even visible in the process memory space
of KeePass!<br />
<br />
KeePass uses secure edit controls only when the hiding behind asterisks option
is turned on! If you show the passwords in plaintext, they won't be protected
(secure edit controls are just disabled then, replaced by standard Windows edit
controls). In unprotected mode, secure edit controls behave like normal
Windows edit controls (no selection limitation, etc.).<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Selection Limitation</b><br />
<br />
A 'natural' limitation of these secure edit controls is that you can't select
a range of characters. You for example cannot select 3 characters and replace
them by the current contents of the clipboard using the paste command.<br />
<br />
If you want to delete all the contents of a secure edit control, press
<i>Shift-Home</i> or <i>Shift-End</i>. This will remove all entered characters.<br />
