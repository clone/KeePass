You can pass a file path in the command-line in order to tell KeePass to open
this file immediately after startup. Additionally, you can specify the password
and/or key-file location for this database.<br />
<br />
The database file location is passed as argument. Only one database file is allowed.
It doesn't matter if you enclose the path in quotes (&quot;) or not.<br />
<br />
Passwords are passed using the <code>-pw:</code> switch. In order to
pass 'abc' as password, you would add the following argument to the command-line:
<code>-pw:abc</code>. Note that there's no space between the ':' and the
password.<br />
<br />
For supplying the key-file location, the <code>-keyfile:</code> switch
exists. The same rules as above apply, just that you specify the key-file location:
<code>-keyfile:D:\pwsafe.key</code>.<br />
<br />
The order of the arguments doesn't matter.<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Usage examples</b><br />
<br />
Open the database file 'C:\My Documents\MyDatabase.kdb' (KeePass will prompt you
for the password and/or key-file location):
<pre>KeePass.exe C:\My Documents\MyDatabase.kdb</pre>

If you got a database that is locked with a password 'abc', you could open it like this:
<pre>KeePass.exe C:\My Documents\MyDatabaseWithPw.kdb -pw:abc</pre>

If your USB stick always mounts to drive F: and you've locked your database with the
USB stick as key-disk, you could open your database as follows:
<pre>KeePass.exe C:\My Documents\MyDatabaseWithFile.kdb -keyfile:F:\pwsafe.key</pre>

If you've locked your database using a password <i>and</i> a key-disk, you can combine
the two switches and open your database as follows:
<pre>KeePass.exe C:\My Documents\MyDatabaseWithTwo.kdb -pw:abc -keyfile:F:\pwsafe.key</pre>
