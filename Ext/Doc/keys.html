KeePass stores your passwords securely in an encrypted database.
This database is locked with a master password and/or a key-disk.<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Master passwords</b><br />
<br />
If you use a master password, you only have to remember one password or
passphrase (which should be good then!). KeePass has some basic protection
against brute-force and dictionary attacks, read the security information page
for more about this.<br />
<br />
If you forget this master password,
all your other passwords in the database are lost, too.
There isn't any backdoor or a key which can open all databases. There
is no way of recovering your passwords.<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Key-disks</b><br />
<br />
But you don't even have to remember a long,
complicated master passphrase. The database can alternatively be
locked using a key-disk.
A 'key-disk' is just a normal disk which holds a file with password
bytes (KeePass can generate
such disks for you). If you want, you can also select the key-file (which
is stored on the key-disk) manually, i.e. one disk can store multiple
keys for multiple databases. In this case, you have to tell KeePass which file
it should use, you cannot simply select a drive then any more (when you
just select a drive, KeePass assumes that it should load the <i>'pwsafe.key'</i>
file in the root directory of the disk).<br />
<br />
If you lose the key-disk (or more precise: the key-file) and have no
backup copy of the key-file, your
passwords in the database are lost, too. It's just the same as forgetting
the master password.<br />
<br />
To backup a key-disk, backup the file <i>'pwsafe.key'</i>, which is stored
in the root directory of your key-disk. If you've chosen to select the key-file
manually (i.e. it's not automatically named <i>'pwsafe.key'</i>), you need
to backup this file.<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Master password <i>and</i> key-disk</b><br />
<br />
Last but not least KeePass supports combining the two locking method above.
Databases can be locked using a key-file <i>and</i> a master password. If you lose
one of them, you cannot unlock your database. On the other hand: if someone
steals your key-disk and password database, the database is still secure because the
attacker doesn't know your master password.
