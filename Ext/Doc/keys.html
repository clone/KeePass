KeePass stores your passwords securely in an encrypted database.
This database is locked with a master password or key-disk.<br />
<br />If you use a master password you only have to remember one password or
passphrase (which should be good then!).<br /><br />If you lose this master password,
all your other passwords in the database are lost too. The database is encrypted based
on mathematics and there isn't any backdoor or a key which can open all databases. There
is no way of recovering your passwords.<br /><br />But you don't even have to remember a long,
complicated master passphrase. The database can alternatively be locked with a key-disk.
A "key-disk" is just a normal disk which holds a file with the password bytes (KeePass can generate
such disks for you).<br /><br />If you lose the key-disk and have no backup copy of the key-file your
passwords in the database are lost too, just as when you lose the master passphrase.<br /><br />If you
want to burn a master key CD-ROM select a writable drive (C: D: ?) and generate the master key-file.
Burn the file "<i>pwsafe.key</i>" (i.e. C:\pwsafe.key or D:\pwsafe.key) into the root directory of
your CD-ROM (i.e. E:\pwsafe.key). You can then insert the key CD-ROM and select the CD-ROM drive in
KeePass to load the key from CD-ROM. For sure, you can do the steps above for any writable and readable
media, not just CD-ROMs.<br /><br />So you must decide: either use a really good master password or
a key-disk.<br /><br />
