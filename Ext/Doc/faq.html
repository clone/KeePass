	<br />
	If you like KeePass and would like to help me in some way:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=95013" target="_blank"><b>Donate</b></a><br />
	This is maybe the best way of helping me, if you don't have that much time or experience in application development. This is
	the recommended way of helping me for "standard users".</li>
	<li><a href="http://keepass.sourceforge.net/translations.php" target="_blank"><b>Make a translation</b></a><br />
	If you have some free time, you could make a translation of KeePass (of course only if you're language isn't offered already)!</li>
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=609908&group_id=95013&func=browse" target="_blank"><b>Test new releases and submit bugfixes</b></a><br />
	KeePass is under constant development, new features get implemented, bugs get fixed. If you have some free time, you could just
	test the new releases thoroughly and if you're a programmer, look through the sources to find bugs and maybe even submit fixes.</li>
	<li><b>Spread the word</b><br />
	KeePass isn't that widely-known yet. If you like KeePass, tell all your friends how great KeePass is, publish articles
	about it, press it on CDs/DVDs, sell it with your USB sticks, submit it to software archives, talk in forums about it, etc.!</li>
	</ul>

	My options aren't saved! Why?</td></tr></table>
	<br />
	When saving the options, KeePass does the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Try to save the options to the global <i>KeePass.ini</i> file in the KeePass program directory.</li>
	<li>If this fails (for example if the program directory is protected), write the options to a <i>KeePass.ini</i> file in the users directory (subdirectory 'KeePass' in application data).</li>
	</ul>
	When loading, KeePass performs the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Try to find the key (the option) in the global <i>KeePass.ini</i> file.</li>
	<li>If this fails (file inaccessible or key doesn't exist), try loading it from the <i>KeePass.ini</i> file in the users directory (subdirectory 'KeePass' in application data).</li>
	</ul>
	Now, if you use the KeePass installer and install it with admin rights, the program directory will be write-protected when working
	as a normal user. That means that KeePass saves your options into your users directory, but loads them from the global <i>KeePass.ini</i>.<br />
	<br />
	If you want KeePass to use just the users directory, logon to Windows with admin rights and delete the global <i>KeePass.ini</i> in the
	program directory. This forces KeePass to use the <i>KeePass.ini</i> in the users directory for both reading and writing when logging
	on as normal Windows user (without admin rights).<br />
	<br />
	A note to network administrators: all settings in the global <i>KeePass.ini</i> file override the settings of the users. That means that
	you can selectively force some options, but leave other options to the users. For this, open the global <i>KeePass.ini</i> file on the
	network drive and have a look at it. Delete all entries that you want to leave up to the user (don't just set it to nothing,
	delete the line completely!). The options you set in the global <i>KeePass.ini</i> are forced for all users, all other options
	are configurable by the users (they are written to the <i>KeePass.ini</i> in the users directory). Make sure you write-protect
	the global <i>KeePass.ini</i> on the network drive so nobody can overwrite it.<br />

	Multi-user databases</td></tr></table>
	<br />
	Implementing a multi-user system for KeePass is a frequent feature request...<br />
	<br />
	All these multi-user / view-only user things are only working if you're using a client-server system, where the user doesn't have full access to the underlying data structures.<br />
	<br />
	For KeePass, a multi-user system would be secure only on the GUI level (since it isn't a client-server application). I could add flags or something like ACLs (access control lists) to prevent/allow users editing/viewing defined sections of a database, but this isn't secure. For normal users (i.e. not programmers and not security experts) the ACLs would work very fine, but anyone who has just a very few bit experience in security can remove those ACLs, if he can read the database.<br />
	<br />
	KeePass is open-source, that means that everyone can get the source code, modify it and recompile it. If it would be only secure on the GUI level, an experienced programmer could just take the KeePass sources, remove all the ACL stuff and would have full access to the database, if he knows the main password.<br />
	<br />
	Since KeePass isn't a client-server application, it's "all or nothing": either you can read and write 100% of the current database or you cannot do anything with it.<br />
	<br />
	So, I will NOT implement those multi-user features. Of course some people would be happy about such features (quote: "I only need it to be secure on a GUI level!"), but soon someone would complain that anyone can modify entries of other users in multi-user databases and KeePass isn't secure. I won't implement such an insecure system.<br />
	<br />
	Some desktop (i.e. not server-client) password manager programs claim to have a working group rights management system, but this just isn't true. They're using ACLs, fine, but this only works on the GUI level and because their product isn't open-source. If you're only USING the program, the multi-user system works. If someone reverse-engineers the file format, he can do anything with the database, just as described above.<br />
	<br />
	Maybe you don't believe me what I'm saying here, since many programs offer multi-user features. In this case, please read the sites below about Excel cell protection security. Protecting certain parts of an Excel file is exactly the same problem as protecting a KeePass database from other users. Even Microsoft says that their cell protections just work for normal users and not on the security level.<br />
	<br />
	Please don't confuse this with other multi-user applications now! Multi-user systems CAN work, but only if the access of a user can really be restricted, for example when you're communicating with some server over the internet. In such a case multi-user systems work perfectly and are also 100% secure. It just doesn't and cannot work with the KeePass desktop application.<br />

	Rename columns / other "card types" feature requests</td></tr></table>
	<br />
	Many feature requests like these have been posted over and over again: rename the columns, add more URL fields,
	add an entry-type field (let the user define whether that entry is a login account, credit card, etc.), hide some
	dialog elements for some special entry-type,
	support different "card types" (you could choose "credit card" as entry-type and KeePass would show
	fields needed for credit card information), etc.<br />
	<br />
	KeePass has been designed from ground up to have the fixed fields you see in the add-entry dialog. All parts of KeePass,
	starting from the core password manager, all the dialogs, up to the main GUI code, are based on this. Supporting
	different card types would require a total rewrite of almost all the code. Really almost everything would
	have to be changed, the tree/listview layout system wouldn't work any more, the database format would have to be
	rewritten from scratch, many of the dialogs would have to be redesigned totally. Short: it's impossible. Creating
	a completely new project would be far less work than implementing this into KeePass.<br />
	<br />
	Even if I would provide the ability to rename the columns/fields, the structure would remain. For example, the URL field
	would continue to be a clickable URL field, though you would have declared it as "PIN" field. This would
	confuse more users than help some, therefore I won't implement any renaming ability.<br />
	<br />
	<b>E-mail address field feature request</b><br />
	<br />
	Especially one feature request is made very often: add an e-mail field. For e-mail accounts for example you would need
	such a field. I won't add an e-mail field, you can use the username field for this. There are mostly two &quot;types&quot;
	of e-mail accounts: either enter a username and a password (standard e-mail servers) or enter your e-mail address and
	a password (web-based e-mail services) to login. The first one isn't a problem anyway and for the second one you can just store
	your <i>e-mail address in the username field</i>. Even if your provider requires 3 fields (username <i>and</i> e-mail address <i>and</i>
	password) to login, you can for example just modify the auto-type sequence (so practically store your e-mail
	address in the auto-type sequence) or store the additional data in the title, URL or notes field.<br />
	<br />
	The end-user must be flexible enough to use the username or URL field for e-mail addresses, the password fields for credit
	card numbers, etc. The notes field accepts the rest, i.e. everything that doesn't fit into the title / user-name / URL
	/ password field scheme.<br />

	Will there be KeePass versions for other OSs than Windows?</td></tr></table>
	<br />
	The desktop KeePass application has been developed from start on to work on Windows operating systems. It uses the Microsoft Foundation
	Classes (MFC) and several other platform-dependent stuff that makes porting relatively hard.<br />
	<br />
	Anyway, the KeePass core (i.e. the password management code, simply everything except the graphical user interface [GUI]) is
	platform-independent and therefor "ports" are theoretically possible, although you cannot really speak of a port here,
	since the whole user interface needs to be rewritten.<br />
	<br />
	Also, KeePass is written in C++. No chance to convert it to Java to make it platform-independent. If you would like a KeePass
	written in Java, have fun rewriting it completely from scratch. Although C++ and Java are relatively similar, converting the
	existing C++ code to Java involves much work, most probably more work than just writing a completely new password manager in Java.<br />
	<br />
	But people can make KeePass "ports", as one can easily see: <a href="http://doncho.net/kppc/" target="_blank">KeePass for PocketPC</a>.
	I assume that, when rewriting the GUI code, you can "port" KeePass to almost any platform, since the core password
	manager code is totally platform-independent.<br />
	<br />
	Now before you ask when the Linux/PalmOS/etc. versions are ready: I don't know. I myself just don't have the time to develop
	these versions. Keep in mind that I'm developing KeePass in my free time and, apart from donations, don't get anything
	for it. I will
	happily develop KeePass for Windows, also in the future yes, but I don't have the time to develop a Linux version
	for example. I also never
	programmed any single PalmOS program, I don't even own a PalmOS.<br />
	<br />
	KeePass is Open-Source. If <i>you</i> have the time to develop KeePass-compatible applications (as said, it cannot be really "ported"),
	feel free to contact me and I will happily support you as good as I can.<br />

	What are those 'Secure Edit Controls'?</td></tr></table>
	<br />
	Secure Edit Controls are special password edit controls that are resistant to window spies and memory dumpers.<br />
	<br />
	There are many tools that read out the entered passwords of standard Windows password edit controls. These standard
	edit controls aren't secure: other applications can easily get the entered texts, even though Windows shows the nice
	password asterisks/dots. Secure edit controls are resistant to this. None of the window spies are able to read
	out the contents of a Secure Edit Control.<br />
	<br />
	Additionally, Secure Edit Controls scramble the entered password in a way that it cannot even be found in the
	process memory of the application. If Windows caches the whole application to disk <i>while entering the password</i>,
	this wouldn't reveal the entered text anyway! The standard edit controls provided by Windows react completely different:
	the password would be easily readable as plain-text.<br />
	<br />
	KeePass was the first application offering this level of security. Since the source code for Secure Edit Controls
	is open-source, most probably many other password managers will adopt and integrate them soon, too.<br />
