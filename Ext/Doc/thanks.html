<b>Icon Theme</b><br />
<br />
Thanks to <i>David Vignoni</i> for creating the nice icon theme &quot;Nuvola&quot;.
Most of the icons (except the main application icon, which has been created by
Christopher Bolin) used in KeePass are icons of this theme. Note that the original
icons are in 32-bit PNG format with alpha transparency, but the icons had to be
converted to 24-bit images without transparency (because KeePass doesn't support
32-bit images). You can find the original images on the homepage of the author,
you can find its address below.<br />
<br />
Usage of the
icons is allowed under the terms of the LGPL license (which you can find
here: <a href="license_lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>), plus
an addition. Here's the original distribution notice:
