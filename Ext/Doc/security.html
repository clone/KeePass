In this section I will tell you how the databases are encrypted. If you aren't a cryptographer and don't
know anything in the security field you won't understand that much. In this case just believe
me it's secure ;-)<br /><br />All databases are encrypted. Currently they are encrypted using
the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES/Rijndael), a 128-bit block cipher, using a 256-bit
key. I've chosen the CBC block cipher mode. A 128-bit initialization vector (IV) is generated randomly
each time you save the database.<br /><br />In order to generate the 256-bit key for AES the secure hash
algorithm SHA-256 (which belongs to the SHA-2 family) is used. The user key (the passphrase the user enters
or the binary string in the key-file) plus a random salt is hashed using SHA-256. The random salt is
generated randomly each time you save the database and saved in it.<br /><br />Each time you start KeePass,
the program will perform a quick self-test where the AES/Rijndael cipher and the SHA-256 are tested against
their correct test vectors.<br /><br />
