<b>Full SxS:</b> This compatibility type means that you can use the latest version
with the listed ones side-by-side (SxS) without any data loss. These versions use exactly
the same database format and are 100% compatible.<br />
<br />
<b>DB SxS:</b> This type means that you can run these KeePass versions side-by-side,
the database
files are compatible. But there are some minor, <i>visual</i> incompatiblities. For example,
from KeePass 1.01 to 1.02, the entry icons have changed. While this doesn't affect the
database file format, creating a database with 1.01 will lead to different icons displayed
in 1.02.<br />
<br />
<b>Lossy SxS:</b> This type means that is possible to use the listed versions with the
latest one side-by-side (database format is compatible), but some data of the newer
version could be lost or displayed incorrectly in the old versions. For example, older
versions don't know meta entries yet and display them as
normal entries. Though no data will be lost, users may be confused when KeePass displays
such meta entries.<br />
The listed versions can open databases of the latest one, but it is generally not recommended
to use them side-by-side.<br />
<br />
<b>No SxS:</b> This means that the database format of the latest version is incompatible
with the listed KeePass versions.
The listed ones are not able to load the database files created by the
latest version. Note that the latest version can load <i>all</i> database versions
(this is called 'full backward compatibility').<br />
<br />
<b>Full Backward:</b> The latest KeePass version can load all database files created
by any older version. KeePass has been designed to be 100% backward compatible, i.e. the
latest KeePass version will always be able to load a database created by an older version.
No data is lost.
