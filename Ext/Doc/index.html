<h2>Introduction</h2>

Today you need to remember many passwords. You need a password for the Windows
network logon, your e-mail account, your homepage's ftp password, online
passwords (like CodeProject member account), etc. etc. etc. The list is
endless. Also, you should use different passwords for each
account. Because if you use only one password everywhere and someone gets this
password you have a problem... A serious problem. He would have access to your
e-mail account, homepage, etc. Unimaginable.<br /><br />
But who can remember all those passwords? Nobody, but KeePass can.
KeePass is a free, open-source, light-weight and easy-to-use password safe for Windows.<br />
<br />
The program stores your passwords in a highly encrypted database.
This database consists of only one file so it can be transferred from one computer
to another easily.<br /><br />
KeePass supports password groups, so you can sort your passwords (for example into
Windows, Internet, My Homepage, etc.).
You can drag-n-drop passwords into other windows.
The program can export the database to TXT, HTML, XML or CSV files.<br /><br />
For sure, you can also print the password list or current list view (see groups).
Using the context menu of the password list you can quickly copy password or user name
to the Windows clipboard.
Searching in password database is possible.<br /><br />
KeePass can be translated into other languages very easily (over 20 languages are available already).
The program has a strong random password generator (you can define the possible
output characters).<br />
<br />
And the best: it's free and you have full access to its source code!<br />
<br />
KeePass is a Windows application. It has been developed using Microsoft Visual C++
with MFC classes. No .NET framework is required, nor any other special DLLs. So
it should run on all Windows operating systems.<br />
<br />
KeePass is distributed under a BSD-style license. To sum it up a bit:
you can use it freely, modify the source code yourself if you log your changes
and don't remove my original header. Because it's free, there is no warranty
of any kind. See the file "License.html" in the downloadable KeePass zip package
for details.
