The application doesn't need to be installed. The KeePass development team provides you
an installer, which automates creating links in the startmenu etc., but you  can alternatively download
the binary zip package. The zip package only contains the main executable, which runs fine without installing
anything.<br />
<br />
KeePass doesn't, in contrast to many other applications, use any functions that require
the latest Windows operating system, such like theming on XP or like a .NET application requiring the .NET
framework.<br />
<br />
KeePass doesn't store anything on your system. The program doesn't create any new
registry keys and it doesn't create any initialization files (ini) in your Windows directory.
Deleting the KeePass directory (in case you downloaded the binary zip package) or using the
uninstaller (in case you downloaded the installer package) leaves no trace of KeePass on your
system.
