  on if auto-typing doesn't work on your computer

  for the patch), this should prevent the delays when exiting

  default values instead of invalid dates/times

- Several minor UI improvements

05/05/14 - 0.99c

05/03/29 - 0.99a

  existing key-disk, KeePass asks you if you want to overwrite
  or reuse it), this way you can use a single key-disk for
  multiple databases
- Settings of the global KeePass.ini now override the settings
  of the KeePass.ini in the user directory (administrators can
  install KeePass on a network drive and force some specific

  strings

- KeePass now releases the Ctrl key for you before auto-typing
- Entry preview window is cleared after a find or quickfind

  multiple key-files on one disk now)

- You can now use command-lines in the URL fields, just prefix
  the command-line using cmd://, so if you would like to

  password list
- Entries cannot be moved to the search results group any more

  password; if the database has been deleted there's no need
  for a password
- Your database won't be emptied any more, if you accidently
  selected too many key encryption rounds, your computer hangs
  and you terminate the KeePass task
- The "X close button minimizes KeePass" option works now
