  content hash
- When closing the entry editing dialog by closing the window

  but the protection against dictionary and guessing attacks is
  doubled)

  character, KeePass now splits the terms and reports all
  entries containing all of the terms (e.g. when you search for
  "Forum KeePass" without the quotes, all entries containing
  both "Forum" and "KeePass" are reported); the order of the
  terms is arbitrary; if you want to search for a term

- Added option to use Windows' CNG/BCrypt API for key
  transformations (about 50% faster than the KeePass built-in
  key transformation code; by increasing the amount of rounds
  by 50%, you'll get the same waiting time as in 1.15, but the
  protection against dictionary and guessing attacks is raised
  by a factor of 1.5; option enabled by default; only Windows
  Vista and higher)
- Completely new update checking system that now also supports
  checking for new plugin versions

  allows independent development of KeePass and plugins, i.e.
  starting with 1.15 KeePass can be updated without requiring
  plugins to be updated and vice versa)

  disallow printing passwords and viewing them in the print

  protection against dictionary and guessing attack is doubled)
- On Windows Vista, some of the message boxes are now displayed
  as modern task dialogs
- Database files are now verified (read and hashed) after
  writing them to disk (in order to prevent data loss caused by
  damaged/broken devices and/or file systems)
- When saving databases to removable media, KeePass now tries
  to lock and unlock the volume, which effectively flushes all
  system caches related to this drive (this prevents data loss
  caused by removing USB sticks without correctly unmounting in
  Windows first; but it only works when no other program is
  using the drive)
- Improved database file writing algorithm (small block writes
  and explicit flushing)
- The system's INI cache is now flushed before copying the
  temporary global INI file to the application directory
  (improves Windows 95 / 98 / ME compatibility)

  (dereferenced when starting URLs and performing auto-type,
  see the auto-type placeholders documentation)
- Added natural sorting (when sorting the entry list, KeePass

  lexicographical one; this sorts entries with numbers more
  logically; only supported with ShlWApi/IE 6.0.2800)

  applicable (if the user name field of an entry is empty, the
  'Copy User Name' command is disabled, etc.)

  now (KeeBannerColorText, set to BGR-Quad)

  in the INI file (KeeBannerFlip)
- In mini mode, no passwords are generated automatically for
  new entries
- In mini mode, clicking the 'Generate Password' button in the
  entry window immediately generates a new password based on
  the automatic generation profile, instead of showing the
  password generator dialog
- In mini mode, the URL field is replaced by a combo box, in
  which you can select one of the plugin-provided user
  applications (KPM_USERAPP_GETFIRST and KPM_USERAPP_GETNEXT)

- If natural sorting is supported, TANs are not prefixed with
  zeros anymore
- Removed 'Loading error' message that appeared when checking
  for an update and a new version is available

  section in the online KeePass help center)

  (%-syntax support for field placeholders was removed because
  it conflicts with the environment syntax, see the 'Upgrading

- Added {INTERNETEXPLORER}, {FIREFOX} and {OPERA} application
  path placeholders (can be used in URLs and auto-type)

  strings

- KeePass now releases the Ctrl key for you before auto-typing
- Entry preview window is cleared after a find or quickfind
