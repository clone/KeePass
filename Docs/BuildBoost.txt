In order to build the Boost library files required by KeePass,
execute Boost's BJAM tool like the following (for Microsoft
Visual C++):

bjam --toolset=msvc --with-regex --build-type=complete stage
bjam --toolset=msvc --with-thread --build-type=complete stage

With Boost >= 1.35.0 you also need:
bjam --toolset=msvc --with-date_time --build-type=complete stage

In order to explicitly use Visual Studio 2008, use msvc-9.0 instead of msvc.
