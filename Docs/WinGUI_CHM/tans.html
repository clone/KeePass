KeePass supports TANs, i.e. passwords of a special form (only alphanumerical characters are allowed)
that can be used only
once. TAN entries are marked as expired when you use the &quot;Copy Password&quot; command
on them.<br />
<br />
These special passwords are mostly used by banks. For some
banks, you need to confirm a transaction using such a TAN, this avoids several
security problems and is a pretty secure system.<br />
<br />
You can use the KeePass <b>TAN Wizard</b> to add several TANs at once to your
database. Just open the TAN wizard dialog (menu <i>Extras</i> - <i>TAN Wizard</i>) and enter all your TANs. The formatting doesn't
really matter, KeePass just uses all alphanumerical characters, i.e. characters like newlines,
tabs, spaces, dots, etc. are used as separators.<br />
<br />
The wizard will then generate several TAN entries from the data you entered into the dialog. Each
TAN consists of a standard KeePass entry. The title of a TAN entry is always &quot;&lt;TAN&gt;&quot;.
This tells KeePass that the entry is a TAN entry, you cannot change the title, username or URL of a TAN (doesn't make sense).<br />
<br />
When you <i>use</i> the TAN (i.e. execute the &quot;Copy Password&quot; command on it), its expiration date will be set
to the current time, which expires the entry. It will get a red X as icon. If you later want to know when you used a specific
TAN, you can just have a look at its expiration date.<br />
