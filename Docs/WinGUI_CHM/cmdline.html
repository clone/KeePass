<br />
You can pass a file path in the command-line in order to tell KeePass to open
this file immediately after startup. Additionally, you can specify the password
and/or key-file location for this database. Switches can be either prefixed using
a slash (/) or a minus (-).<br />
<br />
The database file location is passed as argument. Only one database file is allowed.
If the path contains a space, it must be enclosed in quotes (&quot;).<br />
<br />
Passwords are passed using the <code>-pw:</code> switch. In order to
pass 'abc' as password, you would add the following argument to the command-line:
<code>-pw:abc</code>. Note that there's no space between the ':' and the
password.<br />
<br />
For supplying the key-file location, the <code>-keyfile:</code> switch
exists. The same rules as above apply, just that you specify the key-file location:
<code>-keyfile:D:\pwsafe.key</code>.<br />
<br />
In order to just pre-select a drive, without specifying the concrete key-file location
and/or password, use the <code>-preselect:</code> option. For example, if you lock
your database with a password <i>and</i> a key-disk, but just want to type
in the password (so, without selecting the key-drive), your command-line would
look like this:
<pre>KeePass.exe "C:\My Documents\MyDatabase.kdb" -preselect:C:\</pre>
KeePass would then show you a prompt for the password for the database, but in
the key-disk list, the <code>C:\</code> drive is selected already. When using the
<code>preselect</code> switch, KeePass by default activates the <i>'and'</i> checkbox
and sets the focus to the password edit window.<br />
<br />
Note the difference! The <code>preselect</code> switch just pre-selects the key-disk
for you and displays the login prompt. In contrast, the <code>keyfile</code> switch
doesn't prompt you for the (maybe missing) password.<br />
<br />
The order of the arguments doesn't matter.<br />
<br /><br />
<b>Usage examples</b><br />
<br />
Open the database file 'C:\My Documents\MyDatabase.kdb' (KeePass will prompt you
for the password and/or key-file location):
<pre>KeePass.exe "C:\My Documents\MyDatabase.kdb"</pre>

If you got a database that is locked with a password 'abc', you could open it like this:
<pre>KeePass.exe "C:\My Documents\MyDatabaseWithPw.kdb" -pw:abc</pre>

If your USB stick always mounts to drive F: and you've locked your database with the
USB stick as key-disk, you could open your database as follows:
<pre>KeePass.exe "C:\My Documents\MyDatabaseWithFile.kdb" -keyfile:F:\pwsafe.key</pre>

If you've locked your database using a password <i>and</i> a key-disk, you can combine
the two switches and open your database as follows:
<pre>KeePass.exe "C:\My Documents\MyDatabaseWithTwo.kdb" -pw:abc -keyfile:F:\pwsafe.key</pre>

You have your database locked using a password <i>and</i> a key-disk, but only
want to have the key-disk pre-selected (i.e. you want to get prompted for the
password only), your command-line would look like:
<pre>KeePass.exe "C:\My Documents\MyDatabaseWithTwo.kdb" -preselect:F:\</pre>

KeePass would pre-select the drive <code>F:\</code> for you.<br />
<br />
You can also pre-select files instead of drives, in this case the switch would look like
this: <code>-preselect:"D:\My Documents\DB_Key.key"</code>.
