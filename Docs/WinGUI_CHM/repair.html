Several people have reported that they suddenly cannot open their databases
any more. That's mostly the result of a database that hasn't been written
completely to the disk. For example when you unplug your USB stick before
the file has been written/flushed completely.<br />
<br />
In this case, the repair functionality could help. Try to open your corrupted
database in KeePass: menu <i>'Extras' - 'Repair KeePass Database...'</i>.
KeePass will try to read as much data as possible out of the corrupted file.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you've lost the master key for the database, the repair functionality
cannot help you. Also, if the header of the database (first few bytes) is
corrupted, you're out of luck too: the repair functionality won't be able
to restore any entries.<br />
<br />
The repair functionality should be seen as last hope. Regularly making
backups of your databases is much better and preferred. There are <i>no</i>
security implications if you regularly make backups of your database. A
KeePass plugin automates this, you can find it on the KeePass plugins page.
